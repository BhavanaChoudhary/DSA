// ***** CONSTRUCTOR METHOD FOR SINGLY LINKED LIST *****
//Overall, this code sets up the basic structure of a linked list and initializes it with a single node (which can be removed later).   This node will be assigned the given value.  Other methods can be added to this class to perform operations on the linked list, such as inserting, removing, and searching for nodes.




public class LinkedList {
    // Declare private instance variables
    private Node head;
    private Node tail;
    private int length;
     
    // Declare a Node inner class
    class Node {
        int value;
        Node next;
     
        Node(int value) {
            this.value = value;
        }
    }
     
    // Constructor for initializing the linked list with a value
    public LinkedList(int value) {
        // Create a new node called newNode with the given value, 
        // and point both the head and tail at it
        Node newNode = new Node(value);
        head = newNode;
        tail = newNode;
        length = 1; // The length of the list is 1
    }
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        LinkedList myLinkedList = new LinkedList(4);

  }
}
